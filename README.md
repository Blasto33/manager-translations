# Game Server Panel Translations

![shields.io progress badge (3 of 9 languages translated)](https://img.shields.io/badge/translated-3%20of%209-%2309b3af?style=for-the-badge)

This repository contains all translations used on [mTxServ.com](https://mtxserv.com) for the management panel (Minecraft, ARK, GMod, Rust, Valheim, VPS, Mumble, Teamspeak, etc.).

We're looking forward to get help on a little something. With your help, we will be able to translate the panel in every language possible!

Feel free to add or edit translations in existing files, and submit your [pull request](https://github.com/mTxServ/manager-translations/pulls)!

Language files do not need to be complete, but all should extend at least one other file - `manager.en.yaml` and `manager_game.en.yaml` is the base.

Updates to this repository will be integrated into mTxServ in the very next update: major, minor, or patch.

Thank you so much for helping out!

## How to contribute

1. Checkout this repository
2. If the file doesn't exist in the targetted language, copy one of the language YAML already available (`manager.en.yaml`, `manager_game.en.yaml`,).
3. Replace the right side of the YAML key/value with the translated version of the string on the left.
4. Create a Pull Request: `[Translation] {Language} translation created`
