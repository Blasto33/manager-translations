# Game Server Panel Translations

![shields.io progress badge (3 of 9 languages translated)](https://img.shields.io/badge/translated-3%20of%209-%2309b3af?style=for-the-badge)

This repository contains all translations used on [mTxServ.com](https://mtxserv.com) for the management panel (Minecraft, ARK, GMod, Rust, Valheim, VPS, Mumble, Teamspeak, etc.).

We're looking forward to get help on a little something. With your help, we will be able to translate the panel in every language possible!

Feel free to contribute and submit your [pull request](https://github.com/mTxServ/manager-translations/pulls)!
